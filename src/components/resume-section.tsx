Contributed to two large-scale projects for a major S&P 500 company as part of an Agile development team. My role covered both feature development and design input, working closely with designers and stakeholders to translate business requirements into scalable technical solutions. The tech stack included Angular, NgRx, TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and AWS.
In addition to implementation, I was involved in UI/UX planning, component design, and manual and automated testing, helping ensure quality, performance, and maintainability across releases. The projects emphasized clean architecture, reusable components, and long-term scalability."
